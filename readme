Example of how to resize an ExtJS component (Panel, Grid, etc) without using Ext.Viewport.
You can render an ExtJS Panel, Grid, etc to a specific DIV and when you resize the window/browser,
the component will resize itself.

Tested on: Firefox, Chrome and IE 6.

Sample project developed with Eclipse IDE (http://eclipse.org - opensource IDE).
Eclipse project type: Javascript
